BUILDING AND TESTING

A Makefile is provided, modified from what was included in the startup package.
I put together a makeshift testing harness (make test) that reads from tests.in
and writes standard output to tests.out. This is then compared (using diff) to
tests.expected. Any differences indicate a failed test. There is also a target
test-interactive that builds the test driver and drops you straight into the
driver program running interactively.

IMPLEMENTATION

I chose to add an additional class (NameScope) to model individual name scopes
within the symbol table. SymbolTable's lookup and insertion methods delegate
to the current (innermost) name scope.

Also worth documenting are the SuppressWarnings annotations on the Exception
subclasses. Since the base class is serializable, subclasses are expected
to override specific methods in that interface. That was not relevant to this
assignment, so the warnings are silenced with this annotation.
